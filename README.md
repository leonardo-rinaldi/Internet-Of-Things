# Internet-Of-Things

Hi GitHub!

In this repository there are some IOT projects tha I've create in my free time. Normaly I use IOT boards such esp8266, Raspberry PI or Arduino. Most of it are simple project, other are domotic projects that occassionaly use assistants like Google assistant or Alexa. I also use Node-RED and IFTTT.
